So to day it's some random day, specifically, today is the eighth of october of the year 2010 which isn't really significant because it's not the end of the world yet and i have a huge book to read for english, which i obviously have yet to start, but that's not my only worry, I also have the peesat nimsquat which is on wednesday, the day before ms obamaday.
