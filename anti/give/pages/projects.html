To work towards the mission of "promoting leadership of youth through projects that improve the quality of life in their communities", GIVE organizes and coordinates a free tutoring program that provides academic assistance to elementary school students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. We do this by pairing high schools tutors with elementary school students for a year-long mentorship experience. Starting with only a handful of students in the spring of 2010, we have since grown to providing services to over 100 children and getting over 300 people involved. During the 2010-11 school year we held tutoring sessions at one community center in Annandale, but are expanding to three new locations across Fairfax County in the fall of 2011 in order to reach a greater audience.

GIVE is currently in the process of publishing a children's book, titled "Being Different is what Makes Us Special!", which promotes cultural/religious tolerance and awareness of bullying. These books are to be distributed to elementary schools across the county to spread awareness for this issue, especially in relation to the prevalence of recent bullying incidents.

<h3>Test-Prep Book Drive</h3>

With the end of AP exams and SATs, many students throw away their used prep books. In response to this, GIVE is hosting a book drive in high schools to collect these unwanted study aid guides and distribute them to high school students across the DC Metropolitan Area who plan to take these courses next year, but may not have the means to afford the materials.<br />
